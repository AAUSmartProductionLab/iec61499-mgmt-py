# Design log

A running log of design considerations made while building, for writing the papers afterwards.

**What each entry holds:**
- what was chosen;
- why;
- what it was chosen instead of;
- which paper it serves: *CIRP* ([paper-outline.md](paper-outline.md)), *Journal*
  ([journal-paper.md](journal-paper.md)), or both.

**Rules:**
- Newest entries first, dated.
- Add an entry whenever code or a design changes for a reason a reader of the paper would want to
  know.
- What was decided, without the reasons, still goes into [decisions.md](decisions.md). The method's
  settled decisions are in [design-decisions.md](design-decisions.md).

## 28 Oct 2026

- **The CIRP paper's scope is narrowed to restructuring a module through its AAS.** *CIRP, Journal.*
  - Why: four contributions and three planners in six pages left each half-shown.
  - Instead of: models, planning, architecture and updating as equal contributions.
  - The capability model, the planner comparison, discovery, agents and locations move to the
    journal paper.
- **Effort is counted as user actions, as Dorofeev et al. (ETFA 2021) count them** (`cell/eval/effort.py`).
  *CIRP.*
  - Three ways of making the same skill: by hand in 4diac, in the skill editor, planned.
  - Why: the method is published and is the closest work's own measure, so the numbers compare.
  - Instead of: timing engineers (needs a study), or counting AAS elements (no counterpart in the IDE).
  - By hand counts every instance, subapplication, connection and value the rules build. The editor
    counts each element entered: 2 for a parameter or a step, 1 per field or binding. Planned counts
    the requirement.
  - First numbers: 131 to 151 by hand, 19 to 26 in the editor, 3 planned.
- **The argument for composites as instances rests on the standard, not on FORTE's limits.** *CIRP.*
  - FORTE can load basic and composite types online with its optional Lua loader, though never
    service interface blocks.
  - Why it still holds: creating instances and connections is what every IEC 61499 runtime does
    through management commands. Instances keep each step readable and monitorable.
  - Instead of: "FORTE cannot load types", which is not true.
- **Dorofeev et al. (ETFA 2021) generate one basic function block per composite, from a given
  sequence.** *CIRP.*
  - Their parallel steps grow as 2ⁿ states. Their future work is to keep the skill description in
    the AAS.
  - This is what our instance-only composites, join block and AAS-as-desired-state answer, and is
    why the paper cites them as the closest work.
- **The three planners' plans differ.** *Journal.*
  - GTPyhop follows the module's convention (home after every operation).
  - Aries returns by MoveAxis(0).
  - ENHSP adds a weighing of the empty vial.
  - Why it matters: it is the case for HTN methods carrying the integrator's way.
- **Scaling probe** (1 to 20 doses). *Journal.*
  - Aries grows from 0.08 s to 6.8 s on our HDDL encoding, whose value objects and sum facts grow
    with the doses.
  - GTPyhop and ENHSP stay flat.
  - To report as a property of the encoding, not of Aries alone.
